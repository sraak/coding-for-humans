# Setting the context

## Introduction

Have you ever read an instruction manual? How exactly do you follow them? You guessed it! From the first instruction to the last! Coding is exactly the revarsal of roles. You write instructions for the machine to follow. However, instructions can vary from simplest operation to a complex algorithm. All that computer can do is what you tell it to.

## Everything is a number

Computer is nothing but an exaggerated Calculator. If you are scared of numbers, it's time to get comfortable. Everything in the computer's world is numbers. To be precise, it's binary, but for our understanding our regular numbers will do. You might be wondering, what about all the colourful images, videos and text. Be assured, they all can be represented with numbers. We'll get to them later.

## So do we start with a calculator?

Of course! We'll start there and then build complex things. We need a strong core first. But our calculator is going to be slightly different. No buttons, but one accepts instructions.

## What is an instruction?

Instruction is a basic task that a machine can do. It is so basic that it cannot be broken further into smaller tasks. Our calculator will be able to execute 4 basic tasks, viz. add, subtract, multiply and divide. There will be a few more basic tasks, which I'll explain as we get there.

## We didn't talk about the numbers to operate on!

Yes, instructions are like basic tasks. But you can't execute them unless you have relevant information. We'll call this data. Every instruction will probably need additional data to work on, with few exceptions. This also brings us to the fact that the machine needs to remember certain things. In the machine world, it's called memory.

## How can machine remember things?

Our computer is in a baby stage, it only has couple of toys to play with. Our calculator's toys are nothing but numbers. There are 2 main ways how the baby's toys can be arranged. One way is to neatly arrange one on top of another. Observe that in this case we can put things on top or take things from top only. You cannot reach the bottom until you have cleared from the top. We call this a stack. The other way is just spread them on the floor. I'm sure you realize that now you can randomly pick, keep or replace any item. We call this a heap. In general, most of the instructions will work with stack, however, we will come across some special instructions that will bring items from heap to the stack before executing another task.

Apart from these 2, we also have a magical sealed shelf of toys. You can only take a copy from it, but never change or replace them. And they never go away. They are called constants. They have a special role to play, you'll discover as we explore.
