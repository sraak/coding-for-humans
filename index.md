# Coding for Humans

I have been wondering on how to teach coding in a simplistic approach so that anyone would be able to learn to code. I always felt that many developers lacked strength in the core, which kind of restricted them from doing amazing things. Here is an attempt to make the computer concepts simple enough for every human being.

## Who am I?

I am a developer who started coding at the age of around 10, while other kids were playing on the streets (I haven't missed out on those street games, I have played a lot too)! My passion for technology is has brought me into a successful career in Software Development for more than 10 years.

## Why this?

I am transitioning into a full time music career as I move into a part time developer, I am trying to capture all my learnings here into an easier and simpler format. As I am also mentoring few of my friends into a career in Computer Science, it's a guide for them too.
